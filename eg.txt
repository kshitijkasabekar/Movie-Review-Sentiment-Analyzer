Positive:

The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking. The performances are top-notch, the direction is flawless, and the story is both gripping and emotionally resonant. It's a timeless classic that deserves all the praise it gets.

The Return of the King is a triumph in every sense of the word. The epic scale, breathtaking visuals, and heartfelt performances combine to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. It's a fitting conclusion to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time

Forrest Gump is a heartwarming and uplifting film that celebrates the power of love, friendship, and perseverance. Tom Hanks delivers a career-defining performance, and the storytelling is both touching and humorous. It's a true classic that leaves a lasting impression.

Negative:

I just watched Animal and it was a complete disappointment. The acting was wooden, the plot was predictable, and the dialogue felt forced. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Animal was a total waste of time. The characters were unlikeable, the story was nonsensical, and the pacing was all over the place. I regret spending money on this film.

Avoid Dunki movie at all costs. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting was atrocious, the plot was nonexistent, and I left the theater feeling angry that I wasted my time
